### Every beginning is hard ...

So here I am with my own blog project. It came to me after I saw a video on YouTube about HUGO static websites and found it an exciting challenge.

The video was several months ago, but who has time to take care of the project then? In the end, it was the Christmas holidays of 2022 that gave me the time I needed to take care of the blog.

### What to expect.

It is difficult to predict so early on what the content of the blog will be. The blog should primarily cover 3 points:

1. Be a personal portfolio of myself and my work [Link](/en)
2. Be a personal notebook in which I store code snippets or similar so that I can use them again and again in a central location. [Notes](/notes)
3. My personal blog in which I write ___irregularly___ about topics that are on my mind at the moment.
4. Available to all who are interested in the hope that someone may be helped with a problem.
5. With the ambition to always make all blogposts available in two languages.

### The obvious disclaimer

Even though I make every effort to ensure that the content of the postings is correct, I do not accept any liability for any damage that may result from them. Code snippets and the like are also offered as support and do not represent a solution.

With this in mind: ___Hello World, I guess!___
